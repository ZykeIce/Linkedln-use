The user might be trying to confirm again, perhaps after attempting to log in or if there's a change in status.\n\nI need to use the check_login_status function to get the latest information. The parameters for that function are empty, so the tool call should just have the name and an empty arguments object. \n\nLet me structure the tool call properly. The response from the function will tell me if they're logged in. Then I can inform the user based on the actual data. \n\nNo other functions are needed here. Just call check_login_status again.\n</think>\n\n",
