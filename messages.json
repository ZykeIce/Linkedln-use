Let me call the check_login_status function.\n\nOnce I confirm the login, I should list all conversations to find Minh Huy's thread. The list_conversations function can help here. Maybe use include_words set to \"minh huy\" to filter. But wait, the user said \"read the whole conversation,\" so after listing, I might need to get the specific conversation_id for Minh Huy. \n\nBut the user didn't provide the conversation ID yet. So I should first list the conversations, look for Minh Huy's, note the thread_id, then use enter_conversation with that ID to retrieve the full history. However, the user might not know the ID, so maybe they expect me to find it through the list. Let me proceed step by step. First, check login status. Then list conversations with the name filter. Then, once the thread_id is identified, open that conversation.\n</think>\n\n",

Then I used list_conversations with \"minh huy\" as the include_words and limit 10. The response came back with one conversation: ID \"b44a5024-cd8f-4f28-bf0d-b912424da85a\", participant name \"Nguyen Minh Huy undefined\", a preview message, and some other details.\n\nNow, the next step is to get the full history of that specific conversation. The enter_conversation function requires the conversation_id. Since the user didn't provide it, but the list_conversations gave me the ID, I should call enter_conversation with that ID to retrieve all messages. But wait, the participant name has \"undefined\" at the end. Maybe that's a typo or incomplete name. Should I confirm with the user if this is the correct person? However, the user's instruction was to read the whole conversation, so assuming this is the right one, proceed to fetch the full thread using the provided ID. Let me make sure the function call is correct with the given ID.\n</think>\n\n",
