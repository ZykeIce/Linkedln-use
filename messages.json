So if the user wants to send a DM, I need to prompt them for that. But the user just said \"hi\", which could be a greeting. Maybe they're not ready to send a message yet. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they want to check their DMs. But the assistant can list DM conversations. However, each conversation needs a thread_id. But without knowing the thread_id, how would the assistant list them? Maybe the user is expecting a general response. \n\nBut the assistant's role is to manage DMs. So the best approach is to greet them back and ask how they can assist. Maybe something like, \"Hello! How can I assist you with your LinkedIn Direct Messages today?\" That's professional and opens the door for them to specify their needs. \n\nWait, but the assistant should also check the login status. If the user isn't logged in, they can't send or receive DMs. So maybe first check the login status. But the user hasn't asked for anything specific yet. \n\n\nSo the response should be: \"Hello! How can I assist you with your LinkedIn Direct Messages today?\" That's concise and professional.\n</think>\n\nHello! How can I assist you with your LinkedIn Direct Messages today?"
