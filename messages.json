So, I should call that next to retrieve the conversation list.\n\nOnce I have the list, I can offer to read the full conversation with a specific person. Alternatively, if they know who they want to talk to, they can specify the name, and I can use 'enter_conversation_directly' followed by 'read_full_conversation'.\n\nBut since they just said \"read my DM\" without specifying, the best step is to fetch all profiles in messages. That way, I can present the available conversations and let them choose which one to read. So, I'll call 'fetch_profile_in_message' next.\n</think>",
