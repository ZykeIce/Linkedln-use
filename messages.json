Since the assistant's role is to manage LinkedIn DMs, the tools are the functions available for that purpose.\n\nI should respond by reiterating the available tools, ensuring the user knows what options they have. Also, since the user mentioned \"Current time is 2025-06-12 03:46:02 UTC\", but that doesn't seem relevant here. Maybe just focus on the tools.\n\nWait, the user might have intended to ask something else but phrased it as \"what tool i have\". Maybe they want to know their current login status or list of conversations. But according to the tools, check_login_status is available. However, the user's question is about the tools themselves, not using them.\n\nSo the best approach is to list the tools again, explaining each function briefly. That way, the user is clear on what's available. Also, mention that if they need help with any specific tool, they can ask. Keep it friendly and helpful.\n</think>\n\nYou have access to the following tools for managing LinkedIn DMs:\n\n1. **`sign_out`** - Ends your current LinkedIn session.\n2. **`check_login_status`** - Verifies if you're logged into LinkedIn and retrieves profile info.\n3. **`read_full_conversation`** - Displays all messages in the currently open DM thread.\n\nLet me know how you'd like to proceed! \ud83d\ude0a"
