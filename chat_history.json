This could happen if:\n\n1. The page is still loading\n2. There are no active conversations\n3. A temporary network glitch occurred\n\nWould you like me to:\n1. Try reloading the conversation list?\n2. Check if you have any unread messages?\n3. Attempt to access a specific conversation directly? \n\nLet me know how you'd like to proceed!"
